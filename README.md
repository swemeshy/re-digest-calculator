# re-digest-calculator
Short description: Calculates the lengths of resulting DNA pieces given a plasmid's length and all cut sites


This python script can be run in the command line. The script takes in a string of numbers
separated by commas. Both of the following formats are acceptable:
12, 34, 56, 78
12,34,56,78
These are the cut sites of a plasmid, and can be in any order.
It then takes in the total size of the plasmid and returns the sizes of all the DNA pieces
after a restriction digest.
