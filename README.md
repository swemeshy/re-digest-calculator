# re-digest-calculator
Calculates the lengths of resulting DNA pieces given a plasmid's length and all cut sites


This python script can be run in the command line. The script takes in a string of numbers
separated by commas and spaces. Here is an example format:
34, 56, 89, 125. These are the cut sites of a plasmid, and can be in any order.
It then takes in the total size of the plasmid and returns the sizes of all the DNA pieces
after a restriction digest.

Note: this version is working, but not optimal.
